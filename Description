description . Smart Home Management System Description: Develop a Java-based smart home automation system that controls different appliances and monitors household security. Features: Classes and Objects: Create classes for Appliance, Light, Thermostat, SecurityCamera, and DoorLock. Encapsulation: Use encapsulation to manage appliance states (on/off, temperature settings, etc.) and user settings securely. Inheritance and Aggregation: Create a base class Appliance and derive specific classes like Light, Thermostat, and SecurityCamera. Aggregate appliances into a Room object. Polymorphism (Method Overloading): Overload methods to control various appliances (e.g., adjusting the brightness for lights, setting temperatures for thermostats). Polymorphism (Method Overriding): Override methods for controlling appliances, with each appliance behaving differently (e.g., lights turn on, thermostats set temperature). Abstract Classes: Implement an abstract class Appliance with abstract methods like turnOn() and turnOff(). Interfaces: Define an interface SecuritySystem that has methods for monitoring, and implement it in SecurityCamera and DoorLock. Multithreading: Handle simultaneous tasks like monitoring cameras and adjusting thermostats. File I/O: Store logs of security events (e.g., unauthorized access) and appliance usage data
